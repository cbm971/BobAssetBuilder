# Bob Asset Builder — agent handoff

A browser game maker: draw assets out of blocks (bodies, skins, clothes, weapons,
enemies, props), dress a character, paint a level, then playtest it. Create React App
+ React 18. Everything is in **`src/App.js`** (~9400 lines). Tests in `src/App.test.js`.

## How Blake plays it

From a **StackBlitz linked to PR #1**, not `main`. The branch is
`agent/scaled-hitboxes-projectile-range`. **Pushing to that branch is what reaches
them** — they reload the link. There is no other delivery path.

Assets and levels live in **browser storage on the StackBlitz origin**, not in the
repo. Nothing you do locally can see them, and nothing local can back them up.

## Setup

There is no local clone — the working folder is empty. Clone the PR branch into the
scratchpad and work there.

Node is installed but **not on PATH**. Prepend:

```
C:\Users\cbm97\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\node-v24.18.0-win-x64
```

A bare `node` check lies — it fails even though Node is there. Then `npm install`
once, `CI=true npm test`, `npm run build`.

## Before every push

* **Run both `npm test` and `npm run build`.** Tests only cover pure functions; the
  build is what catches JSX and scope mistakes. Both must be clean.
* Delete `build/` and `git checkout -- package-lock.json`.
* `git commit -F <file>`, **never `-m`** — quotes and dashes break inline.
* Other agents push to this branch. Always `fetch` + `rebase` before pushing. Never
  force.
* No `gh` CLI. Confirm a push landed with `git ls-remote`.

## Verify in the running app, not just in tests

Blake has been burned by fixes that passed tests and were still broken. Tests over
pure functions do not prove a render path works. Start the app and drive it:

```
BROWSER=none PORT=3000 npm start        # run in background
```

then `preview_start` at `http://localhost:3000` and drive it with
`mcp__Claude_Browser__javascript_tool`. Reading the DOM back is the proof — element
counts, computed styles, clip-paths. Buttons have no accessible names, so find them
by `textContent`:

```js
const byText = (re) => [...document.querySelectorAll('button')]
  .find(b => re.test((b.textContent || '').trim()));
```

Seeding fake assets into `localStorage` (`asset:<id>` records plus an `assetIndex`
array of `{id,name,type}`) and reloading is the fastest way to get real data on
screen. Clicking through the drawing tools blind is not — it burns context and
usually fails.

## Gotchas that have cost real time

* **`src/App.js` is entirely CRLF.** Node/regex edits with `\n` in the pattern match
  nothing and fail silently. Convert patterns with `.replace(/\n/g, "\r\n")`. Always
  assert the match count is exactly 1 before writing.
* **Python is not installed.** Use `node -e` for scripted edits.
* `PowerShell` here is Windows PowerShell 5.1 — no `&&`, no ternary.

## Storage, and why it matters more than it looks

Keys: `assetIndex` → `asset:<id>`, `levelIndex` → `level:<id>`, `stampIndex` →
`stamp:<id>`, `backgroundIndex` → `background:<id>`, `textureIndex` → `texture:<id>`,
plus `lColor` and `recentColors`. Read/written through `sget`/`sset`, which use
`window.storage` when the host provides it and fall back to `localStorage`.

**Blake has 50+ assets representing many hours of work, not backed up.** A loader
that throws blanks the whole library, which is indistinguishable from lost work.
`loadLibrary` and `loadLevels` are now per-record resilient (a bad record is skipped
and named via `flash` + `console.warn`); `loadStamps` always was. **Keep it that
way** — never reintroduce a single try/catch around a whole load loop.

If assets ever look missing: the data is almost certainly still there. Back up
first (a read-only dump of every key to a downloaded JSON), then diagnose. Never
clear storage to "reset".

## Architecture worth knowing

**Registries drive the UI generically** — one entry gets you the controls free:
`EFFECT_TYPES` (clothing abilities), `TEXTURES` (level textures), `LV_OBJ_SIZES`.

**Poses.** `ANGLES` is the five base poses (front/back/side/up/crouch), but
`editablePoses(type, wtype)` is the real list per asset type — enemies also get
`attack` and `death`, and a ranged weapon has **no front pose at all**. Anything that
walks poses must use `editablePoses`, not `ANGLES`, or it silently drops art.
`displayPoseKey()` picks a pose that actually has art when showing an item on its own.

**Level cells.** `lv.fg` / `lv.bg` / `lv.front`, keyed `"r,c"`. A value is a colour
string or `{ c, tex, ol, slope, run, step, upsideDown }`. A **foreground cell can hold
more than one fill**: `more` is an array of extra fills under the primary one, so a
gravel ramp can sit over grass blocks and two opposing ramps can share a cell. Read
cells through `fgFills` / `fgSolid` / `fgSlopeFills` — never test `!fgIsSlope(cell)`
for solidity, that only sees the primary fill. Paint through `mergeFgFill`.

**Objects** live in `lv.fx` → arrays of `{ kind, solid, inFront, size }`, keyed by the
object's **top-left** cell. Placement centres on the click (`objAnchor`), so the
clicked cell is usually *not* the key — find an object under a click with `objKeyAt`.
`rot` twists the art, `flip` mirrors it, `ox`/`oy` nudge it — all three move the ART
and never the footprint, which stays the axis-aligned square/rect `size` describes.

**Mirroring a level** (`flipLevelHorizontally`, the ⇄ Flip buttons) is c -> cols-1-c on
every layer plus a reversal of everything that carries a direction: ramp `slope` and
`step`, object `flip`/`rot`/`ox` (and its key moves by the whole footprint, not the
anchor), enemy `facing`, and the connectors via `CONN_FLIP_H`. It is an exact
involution — the round-trip test is what proves nothing was missed, so **anything new
with a left/right sense must be added there**, or a flipped level breaks in a way only
that field shows.

**Layer z-ladder:** 1 bg · 2 fg · 4 climb/pedestals · 5 player/hazards · 6 front.

**Piece rendering.** Cutters (`isCutter`) only punch through pieces in the same
contiguous same-source run (`cutterRuns` / `pieceSrcKey`). Anything that reorders
pieces must keep a cutter adjacent to what it cuts — see `groupWeaponBlocksByArm`.

**Snap to edges** (🧲 checkbox, "Add a block"). While dragging, `findEdgeSnap` looks for an edge
of another block that is near (midpoints within `SNAP_DIST`), pointing roughly the same way
(`SNAP_ANGLE`) and of similar length (`SNAP_LEN_TOL`); `applyEdgeSnap` then welds the two edges
together, taking the neighbour's exact angle and edge length. Polygon shapes snap by their real
silhouette (`shapePolyPoints`), everything else by its box. Two things that are easy to get wrong:
the drag must re-derive the snap from the pick-up size/angle (`drag.current.base`) every frame or
the block welds to the first edge it brushes and can never be pulled off; and edge geometry must
use the same rotation origin the renderer does (`pieceOriginFrac`, arms pivot at the shoulder).
A held group only ever translates — turning it to suit one member would tear the assembly apart.

**Playtest performance.** The loop re-renders this whole component every frame (`setPframe`), so
anything in the level render body runs 60x a second. What is actually true, measured on Forest M1
(160x46, ~8,400 painted cells) — do not re-guess this, measure:

* the physics loop itself is **0.2ms**; JS render+commit is **~2.4ms**; forced layout **<0.5ms**.
* so the frame is not JS-bound locally. The load that was worth removing was **DOM size**:
  `cellRuns` merges horizontally-adjacent identical cells into one box, 8,361 tiles -> 805.
* tile layers are memoized AND each wrapped in its own memoized element (`CELL_LAYER_STYLE`).
  A memoized array alone is not enough but is worth little either — measured at ~0.2ms.
* `groundArt` caches the bake for items on pedestals / lying on the ground; both call sites used
  to re-bake and re-measure every item every frame.

Measuring it at all needs care: the Browser pane is usually hidden, so rAF never fires — patch it
to `setTimeout(cb, 16)`. And **do not sample with `setTimeout(…, 0)`**: nested timeouts are clamped
to 4ms by the spec, which made every measurement read "5ms" regardless of what was on screen and
sent a whole investigation down the wrong path. Post a `MessageChannel` message instead (not
clamped, and it lands after React's own scheduler task).

**Facing.** Enemy art is drawn facing LEFT by default; player art (body/skin/dressed)
faces RIGHT. `enemyNeedsFlip` and `playerSpriteMirrored` are the two answers, and
anything deriving piece-local x from the mirror (muzzle spawn, melee hitbox) must read
the same one as the wrapper's `scaleX(-1)`.

**Weapon flags** live flat on the asset (`explode`, `ignoreArmor`, `burst`,
`burstDelay`, `resurrect`, `stun`, …). Adding one means three places: the `newAsset`
defaults, a `migrate` default so older saves get it, and the editor control.

Comments explain **why**, and usually name the bug that motivated the code. Match that
density.

## NEVER remove a feature to fix a bug

This is the rule that has been broken most often, and it makes Blake angrier than the
original bug. **Fix the defect. Do not delete the surrounding capability.** If a feature
looks like it is causing the bug, you have almost certainly misread the bug.

Both real examples come from the ranged-damage saga:

* Ranged crits were deleted while removing Strength scaling. Blake had said repeatedly
  that **crit chance is the one thing that SHOULD vary per character** on a gun.
* Tag Damage was then made melee-only because a hat made Army Bob's rifle hit 1.5x
  harder. That hat is **the feature working exactly as designed.**

The distinction that was missed both times, and the one to reason from:

> **Gear is a choice the player makes and can undo. A body stat is not.**
> A hat boosting your gun is intended. Your Strength stat boosting your gun was the bug.

So: an effect, ability, tooltip, control or behaviour that already exists is there because
Blake wanted it. Removing one is a product decision and is **his to make, not yours** — if
you genuinely think something must go, ask first and keep building everything else. When a
fix and a feature seem to conflict, narrow the fix until they don't.

## Working style Blake expects

* Ship it. Push fixes directly; don't present option menus. Try things before calling
  them impossible.
* Diagnose the actual root cause. Several bugs here were "fixed" repeatedly at the
  wrong layer — if a fix keeps not working, the data model is probably the problem.
* Say plainly what was verified and what wasn't. Flag behaviour changes that go
  beyond what was asked (e.g. a stat rule that also changes enemy difficulty).
* Do the whole request. It usually has several parts (a bug fix *and* UI cleanup);
  finishing only the interesting one reads as ignoring him.
